# Doctor_visit_analysis
The main focus of my project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of doctor visitation patterns based on various factors, such as age and other related variables. And to determine the number of patients seeking medical treatment for their illnesses. The dataset includes information on income, gender, age, illness type, treatment adherence, and other relevant factors. 

Through this analysis, I aim to investigate how these factors influence patients' decisions to visit doctors and assess whether such visits result in beneficial outcomes.
